# dNFTs for DeFi
### an interactive view of your borrowing positions

With this app you'll be able to see in one place all the mess you have done accross the blockchains.

Thanks to dynamic NFTs, you can see fully on-chain all of your borrowing positions in one place. 

## Roadmap:
1. Aggregate the position from a artificially created token
2. Aggregate the positions from ZkLend
3. Prove that the NFT is a real mirror of the position thanks to Herodotus
4. Aggregate the positions from other chains

## Nowhere near finished
